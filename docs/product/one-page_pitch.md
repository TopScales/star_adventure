# One-Page Game Pitch

## High Concept

**Star Adventure** is a fast-paced mobile *shoot ’em up* inspired by [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), designed for short, intense play sessions. Players pilot a spacecraft through escalating waves of enemies and environmental hazards, relying on positioning, momentum, and spatial awareness rather than raw firepower or complex upgrades.

Tagline: *Move smart. Survive longer*.

## Core Fantasy

Be a skilled space pilot who survives overwhelming odds through precise movement and tactical positioning, not brute force.

## What Makes It Different

Unlike traditional *shoot ’em ups* that focus on firepower and upgrades, **Star Adventure** emphasizes player skill and spatial decision-making.

### Key Differentiators

- **Directional Shields**: Defense depends on ship orientation, not health bars.
- **Momentum-Based Movement**: The ship has weight, creating mastery and tension.
- **Environmental Hazards**: Asteroids and debris affect both player and enemies.
- **Short, Escalating Levels**: High intensity with minimal downtime.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. Start a short level (30–60 seconds)
2. Maneuver the ship while firing automatically
3. Avoid enemies and environmental hazards
4. Position the ship to protect exposed shield sides
5. Complete the level or be destroyed
6. Immediately restart or advance

## Controls & Accessibility

- One-hand playable
- Automatic shooting
- Simple drag or virtual joystick movement

Designed for instant pick-up and play with depth emerging through mastery.

## Visual & UX Direction

- Clean, readable silhouettes
- High contrast visuals for hazards and enemies
- Minimal UI to keep focus on action
- Strong feedback for shield breaks and collisions

## MVP Scope

- Single player, arcade-style progression
- One enemy type with escalating density
- Environmental hazards as primary complexity driver
- No meta-progression or upgrades

## Success Metrics

- Players understand core mechanics within 10 seconds
- High retry rate after failure
- Clear skill improvement across runs

## Growth Potential

Post-MVP expansions may include:

- Special abilities and resource systems
- New enemy behaviors and formations
- Meta-progression and unlockable ships
- Custom ship designs
