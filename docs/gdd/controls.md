# Player controls

- The ship can be moved upwards, downwards, to the left and to the right.
- The ship will always be pointing to the top.
- The ship will always remain in the lower part of the screen. Going off-screen (even partially) is not allowed.
- For web and PC versions conventional <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> keys are used.
- For mobile a virtual joystick is used.
- The game should be playable with one hand.
- No other controls are needed since the ship will shoot automatically.
- Special powers will require buttons, but the screen cluttering should be reduced to the minimum.
