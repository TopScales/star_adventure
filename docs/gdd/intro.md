## Presentation

**Star Adventure** is a mobile-first *shoot ’em up* inspired by Space Invaders, focused on short, intense play sessions. The player pilots a spacecraft through escalating waves of enemies and environmental hazards, relying on movement, positioning, and spatial awareness rather than raw firepower.

## Generalities

Each level is meant to last from 30 to 60 seconds, with compensation to players that can finish the level faster. Unlike traditional *shoot ’em ups* that focus on firepower and upgrades, **Star Adventure** emphasizes player skill and spatial decision-making.

The main features that distinguish this game from others are:

- **Directional Shields**: Defense depends on ship orientation, not health bars.
- **Momentum-Based Movement**: The ship has weight, creating mastery and tension.
- **Environmental Hazards**: Asteroids and debris affect both player and enemies.
- **Short, Escalating Levels**: High intensity with minimal downtime.

The design pillars for **Star Adventure** are:

- Player skill over stats
- Simple inputs, layered depth
- Short sessions with high replayability
- Clear, readable systems

## Game Loop

- Start a short level
- Move and shoot enemies
- Avoid or exploit environmental hazards
- Manage positioning to protect ship shields
- Complete the level or get destroyed
- Advance to the next, harder level
