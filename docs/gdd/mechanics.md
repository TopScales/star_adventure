# Mechanics

4.1 Directional Shields

The ship has directional shields (front, left, right).

Each shield can absorb one hit.

Once broken, that side becomes lethal.

Shields reset at the start of each level.


4.2 Momentum-Based Movement

The ship has slight inertia.

Direction changes are not instantaneous.

Touch or virtual joystick controls.

Sharp turns require anticipation.


4.3 Environmental Hazards

Hazards include asteroids and moving debris.

Hazards damage both the player and enemies.

Hazard patterns are predictable and readable.
Hazards increase in density as levels progress.


4.4 Short, Escalating Levels

Levels last 30–60 seconds.

Each level introduces one escalation (speed, density, or hazard variation).

Difficulty increases linearly per level.

Design Goal: Fit mobile play habits and support rapid iteration.
